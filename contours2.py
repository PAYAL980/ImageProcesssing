# CONTOUR HIERARCHY
# Contour Retrieval Modes

# RETR_LIST
#  Parents and kids are equal under this rule,
#  and they are just contours. ie they all belongs to same hierarchy level.

# RETR_EXTERNAL
#  We can say, under this law,
#  Only the eldest in every family is taken care of.
#  It doesnâ€™t care about other members of the family :).

# RETR_CCOMP
# This flag retrieves all the contours and arranges them to a 2-level hierarchy.
# ie external contours of the object (ie its boundary) are placed in hierarchy-1.
# And the contours of holes inside object (if any) is placed in hierarchy-2.
# If any object inside it, its contour is placed again in hierarchy-1 only.
# And its hole in hierarchy-2 and so on.

# RETR_TREE
# It retrieves all the contours and creates a full family hierarchy list.
# It even tells, who is the grandpa, father, son, grandson and even beyond... :).
